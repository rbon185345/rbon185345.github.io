                    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
                    <p>Uncommon to fairly common, but unobtrusive and easily overlooked, the Eurasian Bullfinch is a small bird, about six inches in length. The male, handsome and distinctive, has a prominent black cap, bright pink cheeks and breast. The female and juveniles are more pinkish-grey in color but note a distinctive black cap and stubby black bill. Soft, plaintive whistled notes may draw attention to predation.</p>

                    <h2>Habitat</h2>
                    <p>The Eurasian Bullfinch favors mixed woodland and edges, parks, gardens, orchards; also farmland with hedges and wooded patches. Except for in Japan and Britain, where they inhabit deciduous woodland and cultivated grounds, they are found in coniferous or mixed woodlands. Their population has declined substantially over much of Western Europe since about 1955, likely due to habitat loss through urbanization, deforestation, and the intensification of agricultural practices.</p>

                    <h2>Talented Singers</h2>
                    <p><br>You are much more likely to see a Bullfinch than to hear one. They have a very soft and very subtle call which is a low, short whistle ‘peu’.<br><br>
                    The distinction between songs and calls is based upon complexity, length, and context. Songs are longer and more complex and are associated with territory and courtship and mating, while calls tend to serve such functions as alarms or keeping members of a flock in contact.<br><br>
                    The male breeding song is very quiet as well, consisting of a descending series of notes, repeated at intervals. In addition, they are a skillful mimic and were popular cage birds at one point, with people determined to teach them different tunes that were played to them. The bullfinch is a hard bird to keep track of and a hard bird to monitor in scientific surveys. However, they do stand out if you’re lucky enough to see one. Now is the best time to see them in gardens, so keep a lookout.</p>
